Hi, my name is George. 👋 I am a self-taught developer. I love to dabble in the terminal. I taught myself python, django, bash, how to use Linux, while working a 9 to 5 (Damn! I am good!). I love doing this! My mission is simple:  

1. Build as many web apps as quickly as I can
2. Run $20 Reddit ads
3. Monetize or move on to another project

I noticed I need to do this quickly and efficiently, so I built this code template.
